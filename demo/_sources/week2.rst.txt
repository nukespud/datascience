Question
----------

What does an Analysis of Variance tell you?  What types of questions does it answer?
What then is the significance of experimental design?

 ANOVA describes how much variance is between different groups versus how much is within each group. Having a thorough understanding of the experiment is an essential part of the experimental design, especial when it comes to known what should be used as the different groupings.  The results from the ANOVA test will tell the how much variance is between the various groups versus within each group, but if the groups are not chosen correctly for the given experiment, then valuable incite may be missed.  


Randomized Block Design
------------------------ 
First I import the table::

  df2 = read.table("fastfood-2.txt", header=TRUE);
  df2

The table is as follows::

    Item1 Item2 Item3
  1    31    27    24
  2    31    28    31
  3    45    29    46
  4    21    18    48
  5    42    36    46
  6    32    17    40 

I then concatenate data rows in df2 into a single vector::

  r = c(t(as.matrix(df2)))
  r

r is viewed as::

  [1] 31 27 24 31 28 31 45 29 46 21 18 48 42 36 46 32 17
  [18] 40
    
I then create three items::
  
  f=c("Item1","Item2","Item3")
  n = 3  # This is number of levels
  k = 6  # This is number of replications
  
  
  # gl() function generates factors by specifying the pattern of their levels.
  # 
  # gl(n, k, length = n*k, labels = 1:n, ordered = FALSE)
  # 
  # n: number of levels
  # k: number of replications
  # length: length of the result
  # labels: labels for the resulting factor levels
  # ordered: whether the result would be ordered or not
  
  # Create a vector treatment factor
  tm = gl(n, 1, n*k,factor(f))
  tm

The results are as follows::

   [1] Item1 Item2 Item3 Item1 Item2 Item3 Item1 Item2
   [9] Item3 Item1 Item2 Item3 Item1 Item2 Item3 Item1
  [17] Item2 Item3
  Levels: Item1 Item2 Item3

Then I do the following::  

  # Create vector of blocking factor for each element in the response
  
  blk = gl(n, k, k*n)
  blk
  
The blk variable is::

  1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3
  Levels: 1 2 3
  
I then do the following::
 
  #Apply function aov to a formula
  av = aov(r ~ tm + blk)
  summary(av)

The summary of av is as follows::

              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)  
  tm           2  538.8  269.39   3.727 0.0525 .
  blk          2  163.4   81.72   1.131 0.3526  
  Residuals   13  939.6   72.27                 
  ---
  Signif. codes:  
  0 *** 0.001 ** 0.01 * 0.05 . 0.1   1


In the tutorial the significant level was set at 0.05. However in this case the probability was >0.05 at 0.0525 so the null hypothesis that the mean sales volume of the new menu items are all equal would not be rejected in this case

 


I also created the response data along vertical columns instead of horizontal rows by adjusting the factor levels accordingly.

First a linearized along the vertical columns using the command::
  
  rPart2 = c(df2[,1],df2[,2],df2[,3])
  rPart2

The value of rPart2 is::

   [1] 31 31 45 21 42 32 27 28 29 18 36 17 24 31 46 48 46
  [18] 40


I then created general factor levels similar to above but with tm and blk reversed::  
  
  tmPart2 = gl(n, k, n*k,factor(f))
  tmPart2
  
  blkPart2 = gl(n, 1, k*n)
  blkPart2

The output for tmPart2 and blkPark2 can be seen below::


  > tmPart2
   [1] Item1 Item1 Item1 Item1 Item1 Item1 Item2 Item2
   [9] Item2 Item2 Item2 Item2 Item3 Item3 Item3 Item3
  [17] Item3 Item3
  Levels: Item1 Item2 Item3

  > blkPart2
   [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
  Levels: 1 2 3

I then ran the command aov ::
  
  av2 =aov(rPart2~tmPart2+blkPart2)
  summary(av2)
  
And got the following summary::

  > summary(av2)
              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)  
  tmPart2      2  538.8  269.39   3.890 0.0474 *
  blkPart2     2  202.8  101.39   1.464 0.2670  
  Residuals   13  900.2   69.25                 
  ---
  Signif. codes:  
  0 *** 0.001 ** 0.01 * 0.05 . 0.1   1
  

In the tutorial the significant level was set at 0.05. In this case the probability was <0.05 at 0.0474 so the null hypothesis that the mean sales volume of the new menu items are all equal could be rejected.
