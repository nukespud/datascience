Find functions for the following:

* Descriptive statistics  (http://www.statmethods.net/stats/descriptives.html)
* Frequencies www.statmethods.net/stats/frequencies.
* Cross tabs
* Correlations http://www.statmethods.net/stats/correlations.html
* How to display these statistics


I read the following textbook:  R: Data Analysis and Visualization

Some notes are as follows:
    
  * c()  stands for combine
  * vectors need to have same data type
  * [] - subscript operator
  * : used for sequences
  * NA is Null
  * Vectors can be recycled (expanded until same size)
  * For loops not needed in R because of vector and matrix capability
  * function.name <-function(argument1, argument 2,...) { #some funciton}
  * sapply (Takes every element in vector and applies it to a function)
  * Can define function in sapply (use instead of for loop)
  * Components of R include:
    * vector data structure
    * matrix
    * data frames
    * list
    * array data structures
  * Matrix:
    * a.matrix <-matrix(c(x,x,x,),nol=?)
    * cbin (column columns)
    * rbin (row combine)
    * apply() 1 rows, 2 column (rows 1 columns 2)
  * Data.frame.  Rectangular array of data like a spreadsheet application (may have columns of different data type)
   

Chapter 2:
  * Univariate data (samples of one variable)
      


Data science working document
==============================
#. Giving me a brief introduction to your data

#. Discuss what you hope to discover about your data, or certain questions that you will solve for

#. Show a header or summary of your data and explain the columns were applicable (max, means, min)

#. Work in R to find your answers to the questions in part 2

#. A summary of your findings, did you expect this? did you not?
