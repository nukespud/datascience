Week 6-1 Text analysis using Unix/Linux
*************************************************
by Joshua Peterson (created in Sphinx)



I downloaded VMWare Fusion and Ubuntu and started to work on the exercise.

The first step is to download the file::

    wget http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10/pg10.txt

Then to ensure the file is downloaded I use the head and tail commands::

    head pg10.txt


The output is::

    The Project Gutenberg EBook of The King James Bible

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
    re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
    with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org


    Title: The King James Bible

Some other useful Linux commands are::

    less -N pg10.txt # View entire text including line numbers

Using the less command I determine that the first 18 lines and lines 99862-100222 are unneeded text and to remove these lines I used to command as follows::

    cp pg10.txt pg10_backup.txt

    sed '99862,100222d' pg10.txt >pg10_nofooter.txt

    sed '1,18d'pg10_nofooter.txt >pg10_noheader.txt

To better characterize what is in the text file I use the following command::

    wc -l pg10_noheader.txt # number of lines the document has

    wc -m pg10_noheader.txt # number of character in a document

The results are::

    99843 pg10_noheader.txt
    4432428 pg10_noheader.txt

To see which words are in the document I can use the commands::

    grep -n "Jesus" pg10_noheader.txt # search line that matches a pattern

    grep -E -n "J|j"esus pg10_noheader.txt # search all cases of Jesus in the file

The output of the second command is::

    99667:21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God
    99701:mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
    99783:22:8 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard
    99811:22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in
    99829:Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
    99831:22:21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

To delete all punctiations and convert everything to lower case and remove numbers I use the commands::

    tr -d [:punct:]<pg10_noheader.txt >pg10_nopunc.txt # removes all punctuations

    tr [:upper:] [:lower:] <pg10_nopunc.txt >pg10_allLower.txt # Convert all to lower case

    tr -d '[:digit:]' <pg10_allLower.txt >pg10_noNumber.txt # Remove all numbers




The output of less is::

    the first book of moses  called genesis


     in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth


To start word count I first remove carriage return characterst that will interefere with the frequency counts along with delte blank spaces and replace them with a new line.  I then sort the words and finally use the uniq command combined with the -c command to count the number of repetitions in each line using the following commands::

    tr -d "\r" <pg10_noNumber.txt >pg10_noCarriage.txt ''#remove false carraige returns

    tr ' ' '\n' <pg10_noCarriage.txt >pg10_noSpace.txt # remove space and create a return between words

    sort pg10_noSpace.txt >pg10_sorted.txt # sort value

    uniq -c pg10_sorted.txt > pg10_wordCount.txt # Count number of repitions in each line

    sort -nr pg10_wordCount.txt >pg10_sortedWordCount.txt

    less pg10_sortedWordCount.txt

The output of the sortedWordCount is as follows::

    64023 the
     58010
     51696 and
     34670 of
     13580 to
     12912 that
     12667 in
     10419 he
      9838 shall
      8997 unto
      8970 for
      8854 i
      8473 his
      8177 a
      7830 lord

.. note::

        The most common words are filler words *the* *and* *of* and the word *lord* is in the top 15 words.  Another note of interest is that the word *i* is used over 8000 times and appears to be a filler word, but in the Bible the word I can also be a significant word and used to describe Jesus such as "I am."  In this case, it is hard to separate the important and not important *I*, but this could be an example of how the analyst may miss relevant information if they do not have an understanding of the data they are looking at.
