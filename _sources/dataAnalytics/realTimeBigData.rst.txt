Storm is one tool that can be used for real time big data analystics.  The information I am writting about comes from the book "Real-Time Big Data Analytics" found on Safari Online.

Storm abstractions
=====================

**Streams** :  endless sequence of tuples or data.

    **Tuple** : data comprising of key-value pairs

**Topology** : like MapReduce but runs forever in is a DAG

    **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph)

**Spouts** : two type of nodes one a spout - the feeder of data streams into the topology

    **Reliable**  pushes tuples by acknowldeged or acking method

    **Unreliable** doesnt keep track of tuples it pushes into the topology

** Bolts** node components that perform the processing in the topology (emit the processed tuples to streams)

**Taks** processing task broken into smaller work items and perform processing withing bolt or spouts

**Worker** spawned to cater the execution of the topology

Storm architecture and its compoenets
=======================================

**Zookeper cluster** orchestration enginer and bookkeeper (submission of topology, create of workers, check dead nodes)

**Storm cluster** set on multiple nodes and consists of :

    **Numbus** master process of Storm framework like JobTracker of Hadoop

    **Supervisor** process do the processing

    **UI** browers based interface to monitor cluster  httP://ui-node-ip:8080

Installation of STORM
========================
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_storm/apache_storm_installation.htm


install Java using command::

    sudo apt-get update
    java -version
    sudo apt-get install default-jre # Used for just runtime java
    sudo apt-get install default-jdk # Java development kit

Install zookeeper framework::

    wget http://apache.cs.utah.edu/zookeeper/current/zookeeper-3.4.10.tar.gz
    sudo mv zookeep-3.4.10.tar.gz opt/
    sudo tar -xvf zookeeper-3.4.10.tar.gz
    cd zookeeper-3.4.10
    sudo mkdir data
    cd conf/
    sudo cp zoo_sample.cfg zoo.cfg

Then I add the following to the zoo.cfg::

    sudo vi zoo.cfg
    tickTime=2000
    dataDir=/conf/zookeeper-3.4.10/data
    clientPort=2181
    initLimit=5
    syncLimit=2

After the configuration has been saved I then start zookeeper::

    sudo /opt/zookeeper-3.4.10/bin/zkServer.sh start

The output should be::

    ZooKeeper JMX enabled by default
    Using config: /opt/zookeeper-3.4.10/bin/../conf/zoo.cfg
    Starting zookeeper ... STARTED

Then start CLI (command line interface for zookeeper) using ::

    /opt/zookeeper-3.4.10/bin/zkCli.sh

The output is as follows::

    Connecting to localhost:2181
    ................
    ................
    ................
    Welcome to ZooKeeper!
    ................
    ................
    WATCHER::
    WatchedEvent state:SyncConnected type: None path:null
    [zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0]


Then download storm using::

    wget http://apache.claz.org/storm/apache-storm-1.1.0/apache-storm-1.1.0.tar.gz




Installing STORM on mac
==========================
http://www.javahabit.com/2015/12/26/how-to-set-up-apache-storm-on-mac-using-brew/


Do the following::

    brew install zookeeper
    zkServer start
    brew install zeromq
    brew install storm


Need to look into kafka
