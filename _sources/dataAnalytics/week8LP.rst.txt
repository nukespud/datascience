Week 8 Linear Programming

The linear problem was from the website: http://www.purplemath.com/modules/linprog3.htm

*A calculator company produces a scientific calculator and a graphing calculator. Long-term projections indicate an expected demand of at least 100 scientific and 80 graphing calculators each day. Because of limitations on production capacity, no more than 200 scientific and 170 graphing calculators can be made daily. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at least 200 calculators much be shipped each day.*

*If each scientific calculator sold results in a $2 loss, but each graphing calculator produces a $5 profit, how many of each type should be made daily to maximize net profits?*


The objective function was to optimize profit when $2 loss for scientific calculators and $5 profit for graphing calculators.  The contracts included the production of scientific calculator was between [100,200], and the production of the graphing calculator was between [80,170].  The total number of calculators >=200.

The R input file is as follows::

    library("lpSolveAPI")

    lprec<-make.lp(0,2)
    lp.control(lprec,sense="max")

    set.objfn(lprec,c(-2,5)) #-2  for x and +5 for y

    add.constraint(lprec,c(1,0),">=",100) #At least x per day
    add.constraint(lprec,c(0,1),">=",80) #At least y per day
    add.constraint(lprec,c(1,0),"<=",200) # no more then 200
    add.constraint(lprec,c(0,1),"<=",170) # no more y per day
    add.constraint(lprec,c(1,1),">=",200) # total of at leas 200 shiped per day
    lprec

    solve(lprec)
    get.objective(lprec)
    get.variables(lprec)

The output from the line > lp.control(lprec,sense="max") is ::

    $anti.degen

The output of the line lprec is as follows::

    Model name:
                C1    C2
    Maximize    -2     5
    R1           1     1  >=  200
    R2           0     1  >=   80
    R3           1     0  <=  200
    R4           0     1  <=  170
    R5           1     1  >=  200
    Kind       Std   Std
    Type      Real  Real
    Upper      Inf   Inf
    Lower        0     0

The max profit possible is 650 per day, and this would require making 100 scientific calculations and 170 graphing calculators.
