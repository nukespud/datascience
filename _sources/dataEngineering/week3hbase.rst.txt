Week 3 Hbase 
============

by Josh Peterson (created on Sphinx)

The goal of this week is to install, configure, and test HBase.  This will be accomplished by following section B.4 direction on the Apached HBase Reference Guide FAQ and the complete the activites described under - procedure: Download, Configure, and Start HBase in Standalone Mode.

This was accomplished by first:

* creating a new VM for the assignment
* create a user for Hbase and the installation.
    
New VM
======

The same steps for creating the new VM for other other projects was followed.  This includes installing CentOS minimual on VMFussionWare and then determining the ip address with the command ::

    ip addr
    
I then use **iterm2** to log into the node and do the following


The ip address for the machines was the following::

    192.168.112.133 


I then used **item2** to ssh into the node. Then on the node I updated them using the following commands::

    su 
    yum update
    yum provides wget
    yum install wget
     
I then created hbase user (on each of the node)::

    useradd hbase
    passwd hbase 
   


The next step is to install java on the machines by doing the following::


    cd /opt    
    wget --no-cookies --no-check-certificate --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com%2F; oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u111-b14/jdk-8u111-linux-x64.tar.gz
    tar xzf jdk-8u111-linux-x64.tar.gz
    chown R root:root jdk1.8.0_111
    alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk1.8.0_111/bin/java 2
    alternatives --config java
    alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /opt/jdk1.8.0_111/bin/jar 2
    alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /opt/jdk1.8.0_111/bin/javac 2
    alternatives --set jar /opt/jdk1.8.0_111/bin/jar
    alternatives --set javac /opt/jdk1.8.0_111/bin/javac

Now I exited root user and switched to the hadoop user::
       
    exit
    su - hbase

Then I *vi* into the .bashrc on the node and added the following to the end of the .bashrc file::

    export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_111
    export JRE_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_111/jre
    export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin



Installing hbase
================

Just like the java code hadoop can be downloaded onto the manager node and then coped to the other nodes /opt location.  This is accomplished with the command::

    su - hbase
    wget http://mirror.synyx.de/apache/hbase/stable/hbase-1.2.4-bin.tar.gz
    tar xzvf hbase-1.2.4-bin.tar.gz
    cd hbase_1.2.4

.. note::  The wget command took to long so I manual downloaded the file onto my computer and then scp it to my virtual machine
    
Then I edited the **conf/hbase-site.xml** which is the main HBase configuration file::  

    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
        <value>file:///home/hbase/hbase</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>
        <value>/home/hbase/zookeeper</value>
      </property>
    </configuration>
    
Then i ran the command below to startup hbase::

    bin/start-hbase.sh

When running start-hbase.sh the output is ::

    [hbase@localhost hbase-1.2.4]$ bin/start-hbase.sh
    starting master, logging to /home/hbase/hbase-1.2.4/bin/../logs/hbase-hbase-master-localhost.localdomain.out
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option PermSize=128m; support was removed in 8.0
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=128m; support was removed in 8.0
    
You can use the command **jps** to view that it is running::

    [hbase@localhost hbase-1.2.4]$ jps
    36864 HMaster
    37185 Jps

Also you can view http://192.168.112.133:16010 to view the HBase Web UI.

.. note::  To view the HBASe remotely I turned off the firewall using the command "    systemctl stop firewalld"


The view of the HBase Web user interface can be seen below:

The following commands can be used with HBase
=============================================

#. Connect to HBase ::
   
    ./bin/hbase shell
    [hbase@localhost hbase-1.2.4]$ bin/hbase shell
